This is a fork of the default openindiana theme with minor changes to the original:

* adding the gnome-autogen.sh script for standalone building of the theme
* change the window control icons in the metacity theme to be perfectly square
* add icons for libreoffice from other icon themes to better match the general style of nimbus

Notes for building and modififying this theme:

Build:
$ ./gnome-autogen.sh && make && sudo make install

(default install location is /usr/local/share/{themes,icons})

Adding Icons:
When adding icons, they have to be registered in Makefile.am.

After modifying theme, be sure to check how /usr/demo/jds/bin/gtk-demo, /usr/demo/jds/bin/gtk3-demo look
and general Mate desktop appearance.
