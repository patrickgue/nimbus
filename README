This is a fork of the default openindiana theme with minor changes to the original:

* adding the gnome-autogen.sh script for standalone building the theme
* change the window control icons in the metacity theme to be perfectly square
* Add icons for libreoffice from other icon themes to better match the general style of the theme

---

This is a repository for default OpenIndiana theme.

After modifying theme, be sure to check how /usr/demo/jds/bin/gtk-demo, /usr/demo/jds/bin/gtk3-demo look
and general Mate desktop appearance.

For building, use https://github.com/OpenIndiana/oi-userland/tree/oi/hipster/components/desktop/nimbus/
component.
